      </h3>
      <p class="mb-3">

        <span class="text-blue-500 font-medium"
          >1- data on how the user uses our Services</span

        partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience,

              Services usage data. For example, this may include information

              internal storage. We support over 500 different Android devices
