        understanding and acceptance of these Terms. If you do not agree to be
        bound by these Terms, cease using the Service and delete any copy of the
        Service which you may have.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3 font-bold">
        These terms also include certain liability limitations and legal
        disclaimers that limit our liabilities. In other words, your use of the
        Service is at your own risk and we do not assume any liability, or make

          Use of the Service is not permitted where prohibited by law. Without
          limiting the foregoing, you represent and warrant that you are not
          located in a country that is subject to international or applicable
          embargo, or a country that has been designated by the international or
          applicable law as a “terrorist supporting” country and that you are
          not listed on any applicable list of prohibited or restricted parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to use the Service. If

          to its fullest extent. In such cases: You represent and warrant that
          all information that you provide to us in creating your Account is
          complete and accurate. You shall update such information when it
          changes or when we request. You acknowledge that we may also access,

          addition to the further indemnification herein, you hereby indemnify
          us and hold us harmless for any such unauthorized use. You acknowledge
          and understand that anyone who gains access to your Account will gain
          access to your all of your data on your Account, including any private
          content.
        </li>
        <li>
          The consideration for your knowing acceptance of these Terms is that

          survive. You acknowledge that we are not responsible to you or any
          third party for the termination of your grant of use.
